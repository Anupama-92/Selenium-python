Use unittest when you need a traditional testing framework and prefer explicit test case definitions and setups.
Use pytest when you want simplicity, less boilerplate, and more powerful features like fixtures, parameterization, and plugins.

Differences Between unittest and pytest
Feature	                        unittest	                                                 pytest
Setup/Teardown	         Uses setUp()/tearDown()	                              Uses fixtures, more flexible
Test discovery	         Discovers only methods in TestCase classes	              Discovers any method prefixed with test_
Assertions	             Uses specific assertX methods	                          Uses plain assert keyword
Parameterization	     Requires additional boilerplate                          Native support via @pytest.mark.parametrize
Extensibility	         Less extensible	                                      Highly extensible with plugins
Output readability	     Verbose test output	                                  Clean and concise output
Ease of use	             Requires more boilerplate	                              Simpler and more concise
