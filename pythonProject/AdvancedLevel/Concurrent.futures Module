The concurrent.futures module in Python provides a high-level API for executing asynchronous tasks concurrently, whether using threads (ThreadPoolExecutor) or processes (ProcessPoolExecutor).
In Selenium, concurrent.futures can be useful for performing tasks like scraping multiple web pages, downloading resources, or running multiple test cases concurrently, either using threads or processes

Why Use concurrent.futures in Selenium?
Speed: Running tasks concurrently reduces the time to complete scraping or testing tasks.
Efficiency: Suitable for I/O-bound tasks like Selenium, where threads are waiting for the browser to respond.
Simplicity: The concurrent.futures module abstracts the complexity of managing threads or processes, making it easier to implement.

When to Use ThreadPoolExecutor vs ProcessPoolExecutor in Selenium
ThreadPoolExecutor: Ideal for Selenium tasks since Selenium operations (e.g., opening pages, clicking elements, scraping data) are I/O-bound, and threading is more suitable for I/O-bound operations.
ProcessPoolExecutor: Less commonly used in Selenium, as Selenium tasks are not CPU-intensive. However, it could be useful if you are combining Selenium with some CPU-heavy tasks like image processing, data computation, or parsing large files.

Using concurrent.futures with ThreadPoolExecutor is highly useful in Selenium for executing multiple scraping or testing tasks concurrently.
It simplifies the code by managing thread pools and can significantly improve the performance of your Selenium scripts when dealing with multiple web pages or executing multiple tests simultaneously.
