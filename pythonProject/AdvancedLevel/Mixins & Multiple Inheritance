A mixin is a class that provides additional functionality to other classes through inheritance, without being the primary base class.
Mixins typically donâ€™t stand on their own; they are meant to be "mixed" into other classes to add specific functionality.

Purpose of Mixins:
To promote code reuse by adding methods to other classes.
To avoid deep inheritance hierarchies.
To separate concerns, focusing on one feature at a time.

Multiple Inheritance
In Python, a class can inherit from more than one class, which is called multiple inheritance.
Python uses a method resolution order (MRO) to determine how methods are inherited in the case of multiple parent classes.
Syntax:
class ChildClass(ParentClass1, ParentClass2):
    pass
