 IDE Debugging Tools
Most modern Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like PyCharm, VSCode, Eclipse with PyDev, and Spyder come with powerful built-in debugging tools. These tools offer:

Breakpoints: Set breakpoints in your code to pause execution at a specific line.
Watch Variables: Track variables and inspect their values as the code runs.
Step Over/Into/Out: Step through the code line by line, enter function calls, or skip them.
Call Stack: View the sequence of function calls that led to a particular point in the program.
Example (VSCode Debugger):
Add breakpoints by clicking next to the line number.
Start the debugger and step through the code, inspect variables, and view the call stack.
