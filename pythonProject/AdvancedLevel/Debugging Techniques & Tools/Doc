Built-in Debugger: pdb
Python has a built-in interactive debugger called pdb that allows step-by-step execution of the code, inspecting variables, and setting breakpoints.
Key Commands in pdb:
break or b: Set a breakpoint at a specific line or function.

continue or c: Continue execution until the next breakpoint.

step or s: Step into a function call.

next or n: Execute the next line of code without stepping into functions.

list or l: List the code around the current line.

print or p: Print the value of a variable.

-----Logging------
# Logging is a more flexible alternative to print statements and allows you to log messages at different severity levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).
Advantages of Logging:

Control the verbosity of your messages by setting different log levels.
Log output can be directed to files, making it easier to trace and analyze later.


-----ipdb------------------
This is an enhanced version of pdb that integrates with IPython.
It provides additional features like syntax highlighting and tab completion.
-----pudb--------------
pudb: Another third-party debugger with a full-screen, terminal-based interface.
It gives you an overview of code, variables, and the stack in a more user-friendly manner.

Summary of Tools and Techniques:
Print Statements: Quick and simple but can clutter the code.
Assertions: For sanity checks and quick debugging.
pdb: Pythonâ€™s built-in interactive debugger.
IDE Debugging Tools: Full-featured debugging environments.
Logging: A more robust alternative to print statements.
Third-Party Debuggers: Enhanced debugging experiences with tools like ipdb and pudb.
Post-mortem Debugging: Analyze crashes after they occur.
Profiling: For performance-related debugging using cProfile and timeit.
Static Code Analysis: Tools like pylint and flake8 for error checking and code quality.
