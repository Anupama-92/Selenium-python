List comprehensions in Python provide a concise way to create lists.
They are used for creating new lists by applying an expression to each item in an iterable (like a list or a range).
The syntax is more compact and often more readable than using a traditional for loop to achieve the same result.
Syntax:
[expression for item in iterable]
expression: This is the item or some operation that you want to apply to each item.
item: The variable that takes the value of each element from the iterable.
iterable: Any iterable object like a list, tuple, string, or range.

Benefits of Using List Comprehensions
Conciseness: Reduces multiple lines of code to one.
Readability: More intuitive for simple operations.
Performance: Slightly faster than using traditional loops due to the optimization by Python.

When to Avoid List Comprehensions
1. For complex operations, traditional for loops might be more readable.
2. If you are performing side effects (e.g., modifying variables outside the comprehension), a for loop is more appropriate.
