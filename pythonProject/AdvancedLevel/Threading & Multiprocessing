Threading and multiprocessing are two important concepts in Python used for concurrent programming, allowing you to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.
They are crucial for improving the performance of I/O-bound and CPU-bound tasks.
Using threading and multiprocessing in Selenium with Python can greatly enhance the performance of web automation tasks, especially when dealing with tasks that involve long waits or parallel processing of independent web pages.
-------ThreadPoolExecutor---------------
The ThreadPoolExecutor is used for managing a pool of threads that execute tasks concurrently, making it easy to perform multithreading in a simple and efficient way.

------Why Use Threading and Multiprocessing with Selenium?---------
Threading is useful when you want to perform multiple browser interactions simultaneously without waiting for each to complete.
This is especially beneficial for I/O-bound tasks like web scraping or downloading files.
Multiprocessing is ideal when CPU-bound tasks (like processing scraped data) are involved or when you want to bypass the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) to achieve true parallelism.
------------multiprocessing.Pool---------------
The Pool class manages multiple processes, distributing the workload efficiently among them.
