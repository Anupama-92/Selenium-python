The main differences between map(), filter(), and reduce() functions lie in their purposes and the types of operations they perform on iterables:

map() Function:

Purpose: The map() function applies a specified function to each item of an iterable (e.g., a list) and returns a new iterator containing the results.
Use Case: It is typically used when you want to transform each element of an iterable based on some function. For example, applying a mathematical operation to each element, converting each element to a different type, etc.
Example: Squaring each number in a list, converting strings to uppercase, etc.
filter() Function:

Purpose: The filter() function applies a specified function to each item of an iterable and returns an iterator containing only the items for which the function returns True.
Use Case: It is used when you want to selectively filter elements from an iterable based on some condition defined by a function. For example, selecting only even numbers, filtering out empty strings, etc.
Example: Filtering even numbers from a list, selecting strings longer than a certain length, etc.
reduce() Function:

Purpose: The reduce() function applies a specified function to the first two elements of an iterable, then applies the same function to the result and the next element, and so on, until the iterable is exhausted. It returns a single value.
Use Case: It is used when you want to cumulatively perform a specific operation on all elements of an iterable to produce a single result.
Example: Calculating the sum or product of all numbers in a list, finding the maximum or minimum element in a list, etc.
In summary:

Use map() when you want to transform each element of an iterable using a function.
Use filter() when you want to selectively filter elements from an iterable based on a condition.
Use reduce() when you want to cumulatively apply a function to the elements of an iterable to produce a single value.
These functions are powerful tools for functional programming in Python and can significantly simplify code in many scenarios. However, it's important to use them judiciously and consider readability and performance implications when deciding whether to use them.
