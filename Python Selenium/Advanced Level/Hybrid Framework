Definition: A Hybrid Framework is a combination of multiple frameworks, typically integrating Data-Driven, Keyword-Driven, and Modular frameworks. It leverages the benefits of each framework, making it more flexible and powerful.

How it Works:

The Hybrid Framework integrates data-driven testing with keyword-driven techniques, along with reusable code modules (like POM - Page Object Model).
Data-Driven component handles the separation of test data from scripts, allowing different test cases to run with various inputs.
Keyword-Driven component allows the tester to define test cases using keywords, which map to corresponding functions or actions.
Page Object Model (POM) is used to separate UI elements and interactions from the test script, promoting reusability and maintainability.
Components:

Test Data File: Contains the data sets for different test cases.
Keyword File: Contains keywords that map to actions (e.g., click, enter text).
Action Classes: Defines functions for each keyword or operation.
Page Object Classes: Contains methods to interact with UI elements on each page.
Test Runner: Controls the flow, reading data and keywords, and executing the corresponding actions.


How Both Frameworks Work Together
In a Hybrid Framework:

The Data-Driven aspect allows the test to be executed with different sets of input data, read from an external file.
The Keyword-Driven aspect allows the test case to be defined using a series of keywords that map to specific actions (e.g., enter text, click button).
Page Object Model (POM) is used to create reusable methods for interacting with UI elements, reducing code duplication.
The Test Runner loads data and keywords, maps the keywords to their respective functions, and executes them step-by-step.
Additional features like screenshots and HTML reports can be included to track results and analyze test execution.
