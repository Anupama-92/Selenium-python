Definition: A Data-Driven Framework is an automation testing approach in which test data is separated from the test scripts.
This allows the same test script to run multiple times with different sets of data, making it easier to perform testing with various input combinations and conditions.

How it Works:

Test data is stored in an external file (e.g., Excel, CSV, JSON, Database).
The script reads the input data from the external source and performs actions based on it.
The same test script is executed with multiple data sets, without modifying the script logic.
Results are logged, showing the success or failure of each input scenario.

Components:

Test Script: Contains the core logic of the automation (e.g., navigating to a website, performing actions, and validating results).
Data File: External file (e.g., Excel or CSV) that contains the test data.
Data Loader: A module that reads the data from the external source and feeds it to the test script.
Test Runner: Executes the test script for each data set.
